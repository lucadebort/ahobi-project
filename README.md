# AHOBI - A Heap of Broken Images 🖼️

**A collaborative art project inspired by T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land***

> *"I will show you fear in a handful of dust."*

---

## The Concept

*The Waste Land* is a visionary poem, dense with fragmented images that compose into a mosaic of meaning. This project transforms that fragmentation into a collective experience.

**The idea:** each verse of the poem becomes a visual artwork, created by a different person. Together, the images recompose the poem into a new form.

---

## How It Works

1. **Request a verse** → The system extracts an unassigned verse from the database
2. **Receive your assignment** → The verse arrives via email, it's yours
3. **Create the artwork** → You have one week to produce an image (1024×1024px)
4. **Contribute to the mosaic** → Your piece joins the collective visual rendition of the poem

---

## The Result

A collaborative visual interpretation of *The Waste Land*, where each fragment is filtered through a different artist's sensibility — just as Eliot composed the poem by assembling fragments of voices, languages, and visions.

## About the Title

*"A heap of broken images"* is a verse from *The Waste Land* (l. 22). It perfectly describes what this project aims to be: a pile of broken images that, together, create something new.
